## Computations

The main reason we use Quarto is because we can include code and execute the code when compiling the document. In R we refer to them as R chunks.

To add your own R chunks, you can type the characters above quickly with the key binding command-option-I on the Mac and Ctrl-Alt-I on Windows.

This applies to plots as well; the plot will be placed in that position. We can write something like this:

```{r}
x <- 1
y <- 2
x + y
```

By default, the code will show up as well. To avoid having the code show up, you can use an argument, which are annotated with `|#` To avoid showing code in the final document, you can use the argument `echo: FALSE`. For example:

```{r}
#| echo: false

x <- 1
y <- 2
x + y
```

We recommend getting into the habit of adding a label to the R code chunks. This will be very useful when debugging, among other situations. You do this by adding a descriptive word like this:

```{r}
#| label: one-plus-two

x <- 1
y <- 2
x + y
```
